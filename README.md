# **Pulse Monitor with Arduino and Python**

This repository contains the code for a basic university project that uses a Python graphical interface to display real-time measurements from a pulse sensor connected to an Arduino via serial communication.

## **Features**

- Reads pulse sensor XD-58C data from Arduino
- Serial communication with Python using pyserial
- Graphical interface built with Tkinter and Matplotlib
- Real-time visualization of the pulse signal

## **Requirements**

- Arduino (UNO, Mega, etc.)
- Pulse Sensor XD-58C
- Python 3.x

## **Usage**

- Add library to Arduino IDE
- Upload the code to Arduino
- Download the required Python libraries
- Find the Arduino COM port
- Modify the Python code adding COM port
- Run Python code
